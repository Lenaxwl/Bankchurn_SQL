# Bankchurn_SQL
Clean and explore the bank customer churn dataset in SQL Server.

## Overview
This project showcases an in-depth analysis of a Global Customer Churn Dataset using SQL. The dataset includes customer profiles such as demographics, product interactions, and banking behaviors, which provide a comprehensive foundation for exploring patterns in customer churn. By implementing various SQL techniques, this project demonstrates the ability to clean, analyze, and extract actionable insights from data, offering value for customer retention strategies.\
*The dataset has 10,000 records and 14 features and it is from the Kaggle, see here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anandshaw2001/customer-churn-dataset*
## Key Skills Demonstrated
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
* Created a staging table to ensure data integrity before analysis.
* Checked for duplicates and null values across all columns.
* Validated categorical and numerical columns for consistency, ensuring data readiness.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
* Assessed key metrics such as customer distribution by geography, balance trends, tenure averages, and more.
* Identified demographic and behavioral patterns in churned and retained customers.
* Evaluated statistical measures like mean, standard deviation, and outliers.
3. Advanced SQL Techniques
* Used window functions (e.g., ROW_NUMBER, SUM OVER, PARTITION BY) to analyze trends and rank data.
* Implemented case statements to group data into age brackets and tenure categories.
* Calculated churn rates segmented by country, age group, tenure, and other factors.
4. Insights and Reporting
* Provided detailed insights into churn rates, customer behavior, and product usage patterns.
* Delivered actionable results such as identifying high-risk groups for customer churn and exploring retention strategies.
* Developed analytical queries to support business decision-making.

## Project Key Findings:
* Churn rate is 20.37%, with higher churn observed in the 41â€“50 age group.
* Customers with tenure of 1 year exhibit the highest churn rates, while tenure at 0 and 10 years correlates with lower churn.
* Germany and France have similar churn rates (~8.1%), while Spain exhibits a much lower rate (~4.1%).
* Average balance for churned customers is significantly higher than for retained ones.
* Active members without credit cards were identified as a potential segment for product cross-selling.
