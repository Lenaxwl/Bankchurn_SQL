# Bankchurn_SQL
Clean and explore the bank customer churn dataset in SQL Server.

## Dataset Overview
The Global Customer Churn Dataset provides detailed customer profiles to analyze and predict churn behavior. It includes information on demographics (age, gender, geography), banking behaviors (credit score, balance, number of products), and engagement indicators (active membership, credit card ownership). The target variable, *Exited*, identifies whether a customer has churned.
